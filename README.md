# TF-IDF
Term frequency – Inverse document frequency in Processing
Processing code to calculate TF-IDF
Inspired by Daniel Shiffman video "Coding Challenge 40:3" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPMYV-eb6lI)
on how to implement an algorithm TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)
that scores each word's relevance for a given document based on its frequency in one document relative to all others in a corpus.
